## 🌱 Overview

**Mind Backlog** helps you slow down, think clearly, and decide what truly needs your energy.  
It’s not about doing more — it’s about understanding what’s on your mind and taking thoughtful action.

You start by writing down what’s bothering you.  
Then you ask a simple question:

> **Can I solve this right now?**

If yes, it moves to your **Active list**.  
If not, it rests in your **Backlog**, ready for when you are.  
No pressure, no guilt — just clarity.
